# AI_&_MachineLearning

## Objectives

This public repository is designed to allow users to familiarize themselves with various use cases and applications within AI and Machine Learning. My focus will be on NLP, timeseries and various financial applications.  I intend to put out seveal applications by end of 2024 for specific usecases within portfolio optimization as well as in applying transformer self-attention within a classification context within credit markets if possible.  

Be advised these will be my personnal scripts and are open for public consumption used at your own risk.  

Updates to this Repository will most likely be Quarterly.  The main idea is to push out 3 small to medium scale projets at least every 4 months as my work permits it. I will have subfolders designed with the relevant requirements.txt file for all projects within this repo on the main page.

#### Transformer_PDFReader is the first MVP version of a product.  

- Users simply download requirements.txt file, include one's own .env file OR use the pseudoapiFile with your own API keys and you will be able to use a fully functional PDF reader intergrated with Langchain, OPENAI, and your choice of VectorDatabase in the event you would like to save your responses.
